My journey of learning WordPress began with a foundational understanding of this popular content management system. I explored its history, version evolution, and various application scenarios, grasping why it has become the world's leading website-building platform. I then downloaded the latest version of WordPress and set up a development environment using a local server environment like XAMPP, successfully completing the installation and basic configuration. In the process of mastering the basics, I started with user management, learning how to create and manage user accounts, and set different user roles and permissions. This helped me understand WordPress's permission control mechanism. I also delved into menu and content management, creating and organizing menus, publishing articles and pages, and using categories and tags to organize content effectively. By installing plugins and configuring tools, I expanded the website's functionality to meet more personalized needs. The template and layout section was a crucial part of my learning journey. I selected and installed a free WordPress theme, adjusting it through customization options to change the website's appearance. Additionally, I learned to use page builders like Elementor to design complex page layouts, making the website look more professional and aesthetically pleasing. For expanding functionality, I conducted in-depth research on installing and managing plugins. Browsing through the WordPress plugin library, I found many useful plugins such as Yoast SEO, WooCommerce, and Akismet. I learned how to configure these plugins to enhance the website's functionality and performance. Furthermore, I explored adding e-commerce features through plugins to enable online sales. To improve the website's security and performance, I studied various WordPress security measures, such as installing security plugins, setting strong passwords, and regularly backing up website data. I optimized the website's performance by enabling caching plugins, optimizing images, and using a Content Distribution Network (CDN) to speed up loading times, ensuring a good user experience.
