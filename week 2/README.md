week 2
I first understood what Joomla is and understood its position in content management systems by studying its history and application scenarios. Next, I installed Joomla. At this step, I downloaded the latest version of Joomla and set up the local server environment through XAMPP. I successfully completed the installation wizard and performed basic configuration. Next, I learned about user management, created different user groups, and set corresponding permissions. This helped me understand Joomla's access control mechanism. I also learned about menus and content management, creating and managing menus, publishing articles, and using content modules to display articles in different locations on the website. At this stage, I selected and installed a Joomla template. Through the backend management interface, I enabled the new template and made basic configuration and customization. I have learned layout management, gained an understanding of module location maps, and adjusted the position and layout of modules in the backend management interface. I also learned how to use layout overlay and customize the display of templates. I conducted a practical project that involved the entire process from requirement analysis to website launch. Through this project, I have consolidated my knowledge and gained a deeper understanding of various aspects of website development. In addition, I analyzed several successful Joomla websites, learned their architecture and implementation methods, and summarized many useful experiences and techniques.
